	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a simulation approach that serves as a “light on the hill” (Smith, 1994) to test options for marine management, monitoring, and assessment against simulated ecosystem and fishery dynamics, including uncertainty in ecological and fishery processes and observations. MSE has become a key method to evaluate trade-offs between management objectives and to communicate with decision makers. Here we describe how and why MSE is continuing to grow from a single species approach to one relevant to multi-species and ecosystem-based management. In particular, different ecosystem modeling approaches can fit within the MSE process to meet particular natural resource management needs. We present four case studies that illustrate how MSE is expanding to include ecosystem considerations and ecosystem models as ‘operating models’ (i.e., virtual test worlds), to simulate monitoring, assessment, and harvest control rules, and to evaluate tradeoffs via performance metrics. We highlight United States case studies related to fisheries regulations and climate, which support NOAA’s policy goals related to the Ecosystem Based Fishery Roadmap and Climate Science Strategy but vary in the complexity of population, ecosystem, and assessment representation. We emphasize methods, tool development, and lessons learned that are relevant beyond the United States, and the additional benefits relative to single-species MSE approaches.},

	abstract = {Deepwater fish are characterized by long lifespans, late maturity and low productivity. This implies slow recovery from low biomass levels and it is, therefore, important to manage these stocks correctly to avoid overfishing. However, these stocks are generally data poor, which it makes difficult to apply quantitative assessment models on which to base their management. The management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach consists in evaluating the performance of management strategies by simulation before their implementation. In the evaluation, the main sources of uncertainty in a fishery system and its management process should be taken into account in order to find robust management strategies. Thus, the MSE approach is relevant to the management of data-poor stocks. We used the FLBEIA software, an FLR library coded in the R statistical language, to conduct a bio-economic impact assessment of fisheries management strategies. We evaluated the performance of several management strategies in three different deepwater case studies using the MSE approach: beaked redfish ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Sebastes mentella{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) in the Norwegian Sea, blackspot seabream ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Pagellus bogaraveo{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) in the Strait of Gibraltar, and French mixed deepwater fisheries in the North East Atlantic. In conclusion, we found that the {\textless}i{\textgreater}S. mentella {\textless}i/{\textgreater}stock is very sensitive to the stock recruitment relationship chosen. For {\textless}i{\textgreater}P. bogaraveo{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, simulations showed that the present constant catch management is as good as more sophisticated strategies. Finally, in mixed fisheries, case study fleet dynamics were key for the success of management strategies},

	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

This special issue, “Under pressure: addressing ﬁsheries challenges with Management Strategy Evaluation”, includes eleven articles highlighting cutting edge MSE approaches and perspectives on improving stakeholder engagement. The special issue is the culmination of a two-session MSE symposium held during the 147th American Fisheries Society Annual Meeting in Tampa, Florida. We summarize the themes from the symposium and special issue articles. Contributions demonstrated that important strides have been made in quantifying and exploring risk (by including more sophisticated multispecies and socioeconomic components), developing and testing datalimited harvest control rules, acknowledging and diagnosing limitations of MSE (e.g., identifying exceptional circumstances), and dealing with issues of stakeholder engagement and dimensionality (e.g., determining appropriate representation, communication techniques, and participation levels). Although MSE is a not a panacea for marine policy and resource utilization issues, it is a useful tool for implementing co-management regimes that should become increasingly robust as the multidisciplinary nature of MSE processes continues to expand.},

	abstract = {The basis of natural resource management is decision making under uncertainty while balancing competing objectives. Within fisheries management, a process described as management strategy evaluation (MSE) is becoming increasingly requested globally to develop and test management procedures. In a fisheries or other natural resource context, a management procedure is a rule that predetermines the management response given feedback from the resource and is simulation tested to be robust to multiple uncertainties. MSEs are distinguished from other risk or simulation analyses by the explicit testing of the feedback mechanism that applies decision rule-based management advice back to the simulated population or ecosystem. Stakeholder input is frequently cited as a best practice in the MSE process, since it fosters communication and facilitates buy-in to the process. Nevertheless, due to the substantial additional cost, time requirement, and necessary scientific personnel, full stakeholder MSEs remain relatively uncommon. With this communication, we provide guidance on what constitutes an MSE, when MSEs should be undertaken or where simpler approaches may suffice, and how to prioritize the degree of stakeholder participation.},

Beginning in the early 1990s, Operational Management Procedures (OMPs) have been developed and implemented for the fisheries for seven important commercial species. Barring a few teething problems, for the first two decades, South Africa's track record of OMP implementation, with OMP-recommended catch limits being signed off by the responsible Minister without change, was exemplary. The sustainable management of some fisheries using OMPs continues without mishap, with regular reviews. However, the past decade has resulted in a number of deviations of decisions from OMP outputs following the declaration of “Exceptional Circumstances” (ECs). This occurred when a resource moved outside the range of scenarios tested at the time the OMP was developed. The reasons why ECs were declared, the methods used to recommend catch limits during ECs and whether ECs might have been avoided are reviewed. The experience gained over three decades of managing fisheries using MSE provides a basis to assess whether the highly time-intensive task of developing these OMPs has been worth the expected benefits, and to provide recommendations related to lessons learned.},

Assessments may be run using either XSA, survey-based methods, or by taking modelled stock numbers directly. Total allowable catches are based on the assessment and harvest control rules (HCRs). The tool can be used for assessing a wide variety of sources of uncertainties within the assessment process. Model structure and linkages are described and a fit to the historical data is presented. A base case of future dynamic (non-steady state) stock trends, based on the existing HCRs, is compared with alternative management and environmental scenarios. The relative differences for each scenario in terms of stock size and catches highlight a number of uncertainties within the biological and fisheries system. The results indicate that the current management rules are robust to the range of scenarios examined so far.},

We explored a range of scenarios to determine robustness of a control rule to different situations and found that across scenarios the control rules that used a buffer to account for scientific uncertainty when setting the ABC were able to limit the frequency of overfishing. Modest buffers when setting the ABC were generally effective at limiting overfishing, but larger buffers resulted in higher average biomass, similar long-term benefits to the fishery (high yield, low variability in yield), more rapid recovery of depleted populations, and a lower risk of the population being overfished, and these results were robust to the level of uncertainty in the assessment model estimates. In addition, fixing the ABC over the interval between assessments and having a short interval between assessments was generally more effective at meeting management objectives than using projections and having a long assessment interval.},
